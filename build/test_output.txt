ARM64 Assembly Module Demo on macOS
=====================================
Addition: 15 + 27 = 42
Multiplication: 8 * 9 = 72
Factorial: 6! = 720
String length of 'Hello, ARM64 Assembly!': 22
Sum of array [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]: 55

Comparison with Go implementations:
Go addition: 15 + 27 = 42 (ASM: 42)
Go multiplication: 8 * 9 = 72 (ASM: 72)
Go factorial: 6! = 720 (ASM: 720)
Go array sum: 55 (ASM: 55)
